**"Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"**
Hi! I’m Kexin Liu (pronounced as Kuh-shin), but feel free to call me Rachel. I’m a first-year graduate student at Simon Fraser University, pursuing a Master of Science in Big Data. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Honours Computer Science from McMaster University. Before diving into my current studies, I was a software engineer at Sugon, where I developed automation solutions and optimized system efficiency using Jenkins and Python.

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
